# Furnicarft 
Furnicraft is a responsive furniture e-commerce website I built using React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. The goal was to create a smooth and clean shopping experience with easy browsing and a layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. I focused on building reusable components, managing state efficiently, and using Tailwind CSS for fast, consistent styling.
